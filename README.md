```lrc
[00:16.34] I'm on the run with you, my sweet love
[00:19.40] There's nothing wrong contemplating God
[00:23.06] Under the chemtrails over the country club
[00:29.67] Wearing our jewels in the swimming pool
[00:33.71] Me and my sister just playin' it cool
[00:37.38] Under the chemtrails over the country club
[00:58.38] 
[00:45.35] Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels
[00:52.21] Go to the market, the kids' swimming pools
[00:59.33] Baby, what's your sign?
[01:03.41] My moon's in Leo, my Cancer is sun
[01:20.41] 
[01:07.67] You won't play, you're no fun
[01:13.79] Well, I don't care what they think
[01:16.89] Drag racing my little red sports car
[01:20.69] I'm not unhinged or unhappy, I'm just wild
[01:41.69] 
[01:27.42] I'm on the run with you, my sweet love
[01:31.23] There's nothing wrong contemplating God
[01:34.88] Under the chemtrails over the country club
[01:41.55] Wearing our jewels in the swimming pool
[01:45.44] Me and my sister just playin' it cool
[01:49.00] Under the chemtrails over the country club
[02:10.00] 
[01:56.79] Meet you for coffee
[01:59.72] At the elementary schools
[02:04.08] We laugh about nothing
[02:07.35] As the summer gets cool
[02:10.92] It's beautiful, how this deep
[02:14.32] Normality settles down over me
[02:18.12] I'm not bored or unhappy
[02:21.20] I'm still so strange and wild
[02:35.70] 
[02:24.98] You're in the wind, I'm in the water
[02:28.35] Nobody's son, nobody's daughter
[02:31.95] Watching the chemtrails over the country club
[02:39.01] Suburbia, The Brentwood Market
[02:42.85] What to do next? Maybe we'll love it
[02:46.20] White picket, chemtrails over the country club
[03:09.20] 
[02:52.78] My love, my love
[03:00.76] Washing my hair, doing the laundry
[03:50.28] Late night TV, I want you on me
[03:53.44] Like when we were kids
[03:55.48] Under chemtrails and country clubs
[04:01.02] It's never too late, baby, so don't give up
[04:22.52] 
[04:07.55] It's never too late, baby, so don't give up
[04:15.56] Under the chemtrails over the country club
[04:17.41] (You're born in the December, I'm born in June)
[04:21.65] Yeah
[04:23.15] Under the chemtrails over the country club
[04:24.33] (You're born in the December, I'm born in June)
[04:47.83] 
[04:30.28] Yeah, my Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon
[04:37.34] My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon
